# INTRODUCTION
This project proposes adapting an IoT-based water-logging detection system initially developed for Dhaka, Bangladesh, to the context of Indian cities. By integrating advancements in sensor technology and data analysis, including the use of gas sensors that detect the presence and concentration of flammable and toxic gases such as methane and hydrogen sulfide in the sewage system, this study aims to provide a robust solution to mitigate the impact of water logging. Implementing gas sensors will enhance safety by providing early warnings of hazardous gas build-ups, thus preventing potential health risks and explosions.
